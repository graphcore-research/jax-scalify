# Alpha-stable distribution modelling

For any $alpha\in (0, 2]$, a centered alpha stable random variable $X$ has the following characteristic function
$$exp(-|st|^\alpha)$$
where $s$ is the scaling of $X$. If $\alpha=2$, it corresponds to a centered Gaussian distribution.

If $X$ and $Y$ are independent alpha stable r.v., the sum $Z$ will satisfy:
$$s_z^\alpha = s_x^\alpha + s_y^\alpha$$


Some questions:
* Is an alpha stable model more robust, i.e. better thanks to heavy tails representing outliers?
* $alpha=1$, i.e. Cauchy distribution has the nice aspect of being very simple!
